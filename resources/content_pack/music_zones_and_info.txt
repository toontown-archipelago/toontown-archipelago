For adding battle music, you can do it like this:
'zone-battle': ['phase_x/path_to/battle_music_file.ogg']

For example, if you want to add custom boss music, you can do it like this:
'dept-boss-bosskey': ['phase_x/path_to/music_file.ogg']

You can input multiple music filepaths into a list for the game to pick a random song each time one plays; like this:
'example-key': ['phase_x/path_to/music_file1.ogg', 'phase_x/path_to/music_file2.ogg'] # You can add as many songs to the list as you'd like

If you want to add NEW music to your music.json, just add new folders and .ogg files (depending on how you'd like to organize) to the extracted content_pack multifile
A key referencing these files in a new folder called new_music would be as follows:
'example-musickey': ['content_pack/new_music/new_music_file.ogg']
