# How to use
To run the accessory placer, simply run the `accessory_placer.bat` file. Any modifications to accessory placements will be saved to the `accessoryplacer/accessories.json`, which can then be used to convert to a compatible `AccessoryGlobals.py` file.

To do this, use the `accessory_convert` file, and it will be automatically moved to `toontown.toon`, so that you can easily compare the diff between old and new. When you are satisfied, you can push your new placements, or continue editing them as you so desire.
