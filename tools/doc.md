# Accessory Placer - How to use

To run the accessory placer, first run the run the `accessory_convert.bat` script to create the necessary `accessoryplacer/accessories.json` file, which can then be read and edited by running the`accessory_placer.bat` script. Any modifications to accessory placements will be saved to the aforementioned JSON file, which can then be used to convert to a compatible `AccessoryGlobals.py` file.

Run the `accessory_convert` script again to automatically overwrite `AccessoryGlobals.py`, so that you can easily compare the diff between old and new. When you are satisfied, you can push your new placements, or continue editing them as you so desire.
