    item_name_to_id: Dict[str, int]  # Mapping of all item names to their respective ID.

    # datapackage if cache is outdated.
    checksum: str  # A checksum hash of this game's data.


# A data package is a JSON object which may contain arbitrary metadata to enable a client to interact with the
# Archipelago server most easily. Currently, this package is used to send ID to name mappings so that clients need not
# maintain their own mappings.
#
# We encourage clients to cache the data package they receive on disk, or otherwise not tied to a session.
# You will know when your cache is outdated if the RoomInfo packet or the datapackage itself denote a different version.
# A special case is datapackage version 0, where it is expected the package is custom and should not be cached.
#
# Note:
#
# Any ID is unique to its type across AP: Item 56 only exists once and Location 56 only exists once.
# Any Name is unique to its type across its own Game only: Single Arrow can exist in two games.
# The IDs from the game "Archipelago" may be used in any other game.
# Especially Location ID -1: Cheat Console and -2: Server (typically Remote Start Inventory)

# Sent to clients to provide what is known as a 'data package' which contains information to enable a client to most
# easily communicate with the Archipelago server. Contents include things like location id to name mappings,
# among others; see Data Package Contents for more info.
